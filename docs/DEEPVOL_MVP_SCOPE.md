# DeepVol MVP Scope

## MVP thesis

DeepVol MVP should prove one real BTC MOVE Receipt path on DeepBook Predict Testnet before expanding markets or fee models.

DeepVol is a Predict-native structured product layer. BTC MOVE Receipt is the primary MVP product; UP, DOWN, and RANGE are advanced primitives, not the main MVP product surface.

The first product is:

```text
BTC MOVE Receipt = Long UP above upper strike + Long DOWN below lower strike
```

The user buys exposure to BTC movement rather than choosing direction.

## Included in MVP

The MVP includes:

- BTC MOVE Receipt only as the primary composed product.
- Advanced UP / DOWN / RANGE primitive surfaces only for validation, diagnostics, or future composer groundwork.
- One active BTC oracle / expiry selected at runtime.
- `VolSeries` object for BTC MOVE series metadata and leg truth.
- `MoveReceipt` object for non-custodial receipt metadata and Predict position linkage.
- DeepVol-owned `AdminCap` and `ProtocolVault<Quote>` for Create Fee custody.
- Preview UP leg.
- Preview DOWN leg.
- Protocol-enforced `buy_move_receipt<Quote>` path that internally mints both binary legs through DeepBook Predict.
- Mint non-custodial `MoveReceipt` after the binary-leg mint path succeeds.
- Charge Create Fee through a separate `fee_coin<Quote>`.
- Deposit Create Fee into DeepVol `ProtocolVault<Quote>`.
- Portfolio readback that combines `MoveReceipt` metadata with `PredictManager` binary position readback.
- A DeepVol-first wallet-gated frontend scaffold under `apps/deepvol-web/`.
- Guided redeem / settlement path that directs users through the official DeepBook Predict binary redeem flow.

## Explicitly out of MVP

The MVP excludes:

- Primitive UP / DOWN / RANGE as the main fee surface.
- Protocol fees on primitive trades; primitive surfaces should be advanced/debug-only in MVP.
- SUI MOVE.
- DEEP MOVE.
- ETH MOVE.
- Profit Fee enforcement.
- Creator marketplace.
- Creator share.
- Listing fee.
- Tradable receipt.
- Custodial receipt.
- Secondary market.
- Pro API.
- Full UI polish.

These can be revisited after BTC MOVE binary mint, receipt creation, fee deposit, portfolio readback, and guided redeem are validated. The 2026-05-19 controlled binary mint round validated the direct two-leg BTC binary mint on Testnet with digest `4fMQtu8mFB6jLa5gtSWBsDj3gYp8u9AjQw3xs2VcNJoh`; DeepVol-3B added the Route B contract path; DeepVol-4 records the manual Testnet package publish plus shared `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>` setup in [DEEPVOL_TESTNET_PUBLISH_RESULT.md](./DEEPVOL_TESTNET_PUBLISH_RESULT.md); and DeepVol-5 validates the first deployed BTC `VolSeries`, `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>`, `MoveReceipt`, internal UP/DOWN mints, and Create Fee deposit in [DEEPVOL_BUY_MOVE_RECEIPT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md](./DEEPVOL_BUY_MOVE_RECEIPT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md). Guided redeem remains future MVP work.

## Runtime assumptions

Market availability is a runtime DeepBook Predict condition. The MVP should mark active oracle, expiry, strikes, and quote values as `MUST CONFIRM AT RUNTIME` until discovered from current Testnet state.

The first implementation should prefer runtime discovery over hardcoded market assumptions. If no suitable active BTC binary market exists, the app should report a precise blocker instead of presenting unavailable markets.

## Implementation phases

1. Confirm binary leg entrypoints and source-level semantics.
2. Clarify the primitives-vs-receipts product layer.
3. Add a read-only BTC binary leg validation harness for quote, MarketKey construction, readback, and devInspect-only preflight.
4. Validate BTC binary quote preview for both UP and DOWN legs.
5. Validate a two-leg binary mint PTB in devInspect.
6. Run a controlled binary mint round and document the result. The 2026-05-19 round diagnosed the old `InsufficientGas in command 3` as a too-low `100000000` MIST gas budget and validated one real two-leg mint at `200000000` MIST.
7. Add DeepVol-3 local skeleton for `VolSeries`, non-custodial `MoveReceipt`, Create Fee calculation/recording, TypeScript stubs, and docs without publishing or executing transactions.
8. Upgrade to DeepVol-3B Route B contract code: DeepVol derives both binary legs from `VolSeries`, calls Predict mint twice inside `buy_move_receipt<Quote>`, and deposits Create Fee into a DeepVol-owned vault.
9. Record DeepVol-4 manual Testnet publish/configuration and create the shared `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>`.
10. Validate fresh quote, fee coin, full preflight, execution, and post-state gates around the deployed `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` path. DeepVol-5 completed this for one runtime-selected BTC series with buy digest `GVyMBH9kB6nTSuWoULFZ5ir3yhFnRC8LNoRz9EEDQXbd`.
11. Add the DeepVol-6 wallet-gated frontend scaffold under `apps/deepvol-web/`, separate from the prior RangePilot `apps/web` validation UI.
12. Add completed browser-safe portfolio readback and guided settlement UI.
13. Revisit V2 custodial / escrow receipts and Profit Fee only after the non-custodial MVP is validated.

## Code organization

DeepVol local contract and TypeScript paths:

```text
move/deepvol/
packages/types/src/deepVol.ts
packages/sdk/src/deepVol/
packages/config/src/deepVolTestnet.ts
```

DeepVol frontend scaffold:

```text
apps/deepvol-web/
```

`apps/web/` remains the prior RangePilot validation UI. Future DeepVol UX work should build from `apps/deepvol-web/`, not by patching DeepVol pages into the old scaffold.
