# DeepVol MoveReceipt Contract

## Scope

DeepVol-3B upgraded `move/deepvol` from a metadata-only receipt skeleton to the Route B contract model:

```text
VolSeries-defined BTC MOVE series
+ DeepVol-internal Predict UP mint at upper strike
+ DeepVol-internal Predict DOWN mint at lower strike
+ DeepVol Create Fee deposit
+ owned MoveReceipt
```

The receipt remains non-custodial because the underlying DeepBook Predict positions stay in the user's `PredictManager`. It is protocol-enforced because the public receipt creation path now mints both Predict legs inside `receipt::buy_move_receipt<Quote>` before the receipt is created.

DeepVol-4 records the manual Testnet package publish and creates the shared `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>`. DeepVol-5 validates the first deployed `receipt::buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` transaction with fresh quote, fee coin, full preflight gates, internal UP/DOWN Predict mints, receipt readback, and ProtocolVault fee accounting; see [DEEPVOL_BUY_MOVE_RECEIPT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md](./DEEPVOL_BUY_MOVE_RECEIPT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md).

## Package boundary

The package is intentionally independent:

- depends on DeepBook Predict and DeepBook packages directly;
- does not depend on `move/rangepilot` or RangePilot Move modules;
- owns DeepVol `errors`, `fees`, `series`, `receipt`, and `vault` modules;
- owns its own `AdminCap` and `ProtocolVault<Quote>` for Create Fee custody;
- does not accept caller-supplied UP/DOWN leg metadata.

DeepVol derives UP from `VolSeries.upper_strike` and DOWN from `VolSeries.lower_strike`. The public SDK builder composes only the DeepVol Route B call; it does not discover quotes, select fee coins, sign, execute, publish, or bypass fresh preflight gates.

## VolSeries

`VolSeries` is a shared object describing one BTC MOVE product series.

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Sui object identity. |
| `creator` | Address that created the series. |
| `oracle_id` | DeepBook Predict oracle ID this series refers to. |
| `expiry` | Expiry timestamp in milliseconds. |
| `lower_strike` | DOWN leg strike. |
| `upper_strike` | UP leg strike. |
| `metadata_uri` | Nonempty metadata URI bytes for UI/indexer data. |
| `create_fee_bps` | Create Fee basis points for this series. |
| `active` | Whether new receipts can be created. |
| `created_at_ms` | Creation timestamp from `Clock`. |

Validation rules:

- `metadata_uri` must be nonempty.
- `lower_strike < upper_strike`.
- `expiry > Clock.timestamp_ms()`.
- `create_fee_bps <= 100` through `deepvol::fees`.
- only the creator can deactivate the series.

Entrypoints:

| Entrypoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `series::create_series` | Creates and shares a validated `VolSeries`, then emits `VolSeriesCreated`. **Permissionless** — no AdminCap required. Any wallet can create a series. |
| `series::deactivate_series` | Creator-only state update that sets `active = false` and emits `VolSeriesDeactivated`. |

Note: `create_series` is `public entry` and permissionless. A fresh VolSeries is required for new BTC MOVE buys when the active BTC market oracle/expiry changes, but successful creation is not proof that the derived UP and DOWN Predict legs are mintable. See `docs/DEEPVOL_ACTIVE_MOVE_SERIES.md` for the active series lifecycle and `docs/DEEPVOL_MINTABLE_MOVE_RANGE.md` for the mintability gate.

## ProtocolVault

`deepvol::vault` defines DeepVol-owned fee custody:

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AdminCap` | Package admin capability minted to the publisher during package init. |
| `ProtocolVault<Quote>` | Shared quote-asset fee vault that stores Create Fee balances. |

Entrypoints and package functions:

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `vault::create_protocol_vault<Quote>` | Admin-only creation of a shared `ProtocolVault<Quote>`. |
| `vault::deposit_create_fee<Quote>` | Package-callable deposit used by `receipt::buy_move_receipt<Quote>`. |
| `vault::withdraw_protocol_fees<Quote>` | Admin-only withdrawal from the DeepVol fee vault. |
| `vault::protocol_vault_balance<Quote>` | Read helper returning the current vault balance. |

The vault holds only DeepVol Create Fees. It does not custody Predict positions, Predict payouts, or user manager balances.

## Route B receipt creation

The unsafe public metadata-only `receipt::create_move_receipt` product path is removed. The product path is now:

```move
public entry fun buy_move_receipt<Quote>(
    series: &VolSeries,
    predict: &mut Predict,
    manager: &mut PredictManager,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    fee_coin: Coin<Quote>,
    protocol_vault: &mut ProtocolVault<Quote>,
    quantity: u64,
    max_premium_paid: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

The entrypoint enforces this sequence:

1. require active `VolSeries`;
2. require nonzero quantity and nonzero `max_premium_paid`;
3. require `predict_manager::owner(manager) == ctx.sender()`;
4. require the supplied oracle object ID matches `series.oracle_id`;
5. derive UP key with `market_key::up(series.oracle_id, series.expiry, series.upper_strike)`;
6. derive DOWN key with `market_key::down(series.oracle_id, series.expiry, series.lower_strike)`;
7. quote both legs through `predict::get_trade_amounts` immediately before mint and require the quote is within `max_premium_paid`;
8. fail atomically if either derived Predict leg is not mintable, including `predict::assert_mintable_ask::7` / `EAskPriceOutOfBounds`;
9. require the separate `fee_coin<Quote>` covers the Create Fee implied by the quote;
10. read the manager's quote-asset balance before minting;
11. call `predict::mint<Quote>` for the UP leg;
12. call `predict::mint<Quote>` for the DOWN leg;
13. derive `premium_paid` from the manager balance delta and require the actual delta is within `max_premium_paid`;
14. calculate Create Fee from the actual `premium_paid`, deposit it into `ProtocolVault<Quote>`, and return any fee coin remainder;
15. create `MoveReceipt`, emit `MoveReceiptCreated`, and transfer it to the sender.

If either Predict mint or the fee deposit aborts, Sui transaction atomicity prevents the receipt and fee side effects from persisting.

## MoveReceipt

`MoveReceipt` is an owned metadata/linkage object transferred to the buyer. It does not custody or control the underlying DeepBook Predict binary positions.

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Sui object identity. |
| `owner` | Receipt owner. |
| `series_id` | Linked `VolSeries` ID. |
| `predict_manager_id` | User `PredictManager` that receives the UP/DOWN legs. |
| `oracle_id` | Copied from the series. |
| `expiry` | Copied from the series. |
| `lower_strike` | Copied from the series. |
| `upper_strike` | Copied from the series. |
| `up_strike` | Derived from `upper_strike`. |
| `down_strike` | Derived from `lower_strike`. |
| `quantity` | Quantity minted for each binary leg. |
| `premium_paid` | Actual quote-asset balance delta from the user's `PredictManager` across the two internal Predict mints. |
| `create_fee_paid` | Create Fee deposited into the DeepVol vault. |
| `created_at_ms` | Receipt creation timestamp. |
| `status` | Receipt-local lifecycle status. |

`predict::mint<Quote>` does not return the charged cost, so DeepVol records the actual quote-asset balance delta from `predict_manager::balance<Quote>` before and after the two mints. The immediate quote remains a preflight and early fee-coin coverage check; the receipt, final max-premium cap, and final Create Fee use the actual manager balance delta.

Status constants:

| Status | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `STATUS_ACTIVE` | `0` | Receipt is active/open from DeepVol's metadata perspective. |
| `STATUS_SETTLED` | `1` | Owner marked the receipt settled through DeepVol metadata. |
| `STATUS_CANCELLED` | `2` | Reserved for future lifecycle work. |

Entrypoints:

| Entrypoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `receipt::buy_move_receipt<Quote>` | Protocol-enforced receipt creation that internally mints both Predict binary legs, deposits Create Fee, emits `MoveReceiptCreated`, and transfers the receipt to the sender. |
| `receipt::mark_receipt_settled` | Owner-only metadata status update from active to settled; emits `MoveReceiptMarkedSettled`. |

`mark_receipt_settled` is not proof of binary redeem or payout. It is only a receipt-local marker.

## Create Fee

`deepvol::fees` defines:

| Constant | Value |
|---|---:|
| `BPS_DENOMINATOR` | `10000` |
| `DEFAULT_CREATE_FEE_BPS` | `30` |
| `MAX_CREATE_FEE_BPS` | `100` |

`calculate_create_fee(premium_paid, create_fee_bps)` requires `premium_paid > 0`, enforces the max fee bps, and returns:

```text
premium_paid * create_fee_bps / 10000
```

Integer division means tiny premiums can calculate a zero fee. DeepVol-3B accepts this and does not add a minimum-fee policy.

Predict mint costs are paid from the user's `PredictManager` balance by DeepBook Predict. DeepVol Create Fee is paid separately through `fee_coin<Quote>` and deposited into `ProtocolVault<Quote>`.

## Publish and deployment status

DeepVol Route B is now published on Sui Testnet, and the DUSDC ProtocolVault is configured after the DeepVol-4 setup transaction. Concrete package, vault, AdminCap, UpgradeCap, publisher, and setup digest values are recorded in [DEEPVOL_TESTNET_PUBLISH_RESULT.md](./DEEPVOL_TESTNET_PUBLISH_RESULT.md) and `packages/config/src/deepVolTestnet.ts`.

Current deployment state:

- DeepVol package ID is configured.
- DeepVol `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>` ID is configured.
- DeepVol `AdminCap` and `UpgradeCap` IDs are documented as admin-only objects.
- DeepVol-5 created real VolSeries `0x57878763c144cabe06c86d7e02f168d6b42481d779434d8efc8146a10c1ba885` with digest `JCHonGTMEikMBtxWkZpUbhDWNZjMCoSDJNbRuVBHTLUk`.
- DeepVol-5 minted real MoveReceipt `0x6eac478ef6300281093a2301a52b4ee7b272d6b1a76be9e16e63fa43171f6a0f` with buy digest `GVyMBH9kB6nTSuWoULFZ5ir3yhFnRC8LNoRz9EEDQXbd`.
- DeepVol-5 verified internal DeepBook Predict UP and DOWN mints, UP/DOWN position deltas of `10000`, manager DUSDC premium delta `10029`, and ProtocolVault Create Fee delta `30`.
- No DeepBook Predict redeem was executed in DeepVol-5.
- No DeepVol withdrawal was executed in DeepVol-5.

The next phase is wallet-gated DeepVol receipt UX and guided settlement work using the validated deployed `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` path with fresh runtime market discovery, quote previews, fee coin preparation, full preflight, wallet approval, and post-transaction receipt/position/event checks.

## Fresh buy validation (DeepVol-20)

The full `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` flow was validated on Testnet using a freshly created VolSeries (not the original DeepVol-5 configured series). Transaction digest `6sq8ZydZS3sLXNU6Y31gxSqBniVdf7SEXMwiKzJmjbXg` confirmed:

- Both UP and DOWN Predict legs minted successfully.
- Create fee (28 atomic DUSDC) deposited to `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>`.
- `MoveReceiptCreated` event emitted.
- MoveReceipt object `0x85d803ae6b8a66f6d0e0772e8906d8076dea210de3eaa322d712db58eb6ff869` transferred to sender.

This validates the Route B receipt creation sequence (steps 1–15) end-to-end. Prior validation used the DeepVol-5 configured series; this validates the full active-market → mintable-range → create-series → buy path.
