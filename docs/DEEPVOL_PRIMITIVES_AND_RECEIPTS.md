# DeepVol Primitives and Receipts

## Product layers

DeepVol is a Predict-native structured product layer. It uses official DeepBook Predict primitives and packages selected combinations into product receipts.

DeepVol exposes two product layers:

1. Predict primitives:
   - UP
   - DOWN
   - RANGE

2. Composed receipts:
   - BTC MOVE = UP + DOWN

This framing keeps DeepVol from becoming a generic Predict UI. The primary product is the composed receipt layer, while primitives remain available for advanced validation, education, and future composer workflows.

## Predict primitives

UP, DOWN, and RANGE are official DeepBook Predict primitives. DeepVol should expose them only as advanced primitives in the MVP, not as the main product or the main fee source.

Primitive responsibilities remain with DeepBook Predict:

- quote and pricing;
- market and oracle lifecycle;
- vault exposure and risk;
- mint, redeem, and settlement behavior;
- `PredictManager` position accounting.

DeepVol must not reimplement those responsibilities.

## Composed receipts

Composed receipts are productized multi-leg strategies built from Predict primitives. They add standardization, portfolio metadata, fee accounting, and guided settlement around official Predict positions.

The MVP composed receipt is BTC MOVE:

```text
BTC MOVE Receipt = UP upper binary leg + DOWN lower binary leg
```

The receipt records the product series, selected oracle, expiry, strikes, premium, fee, and Predict position linkage. In MVP, it does not custody the underlying Predict legs.

DeepVol-3B makes receipt creation protocol-enforced: `receipt::buy_move_receipt<Quote>` derives both legs from `VolSeries`, calls DeepBook Predict mint for both legs, deposits Create Fee, and only then mints the receipt.

## Primary MVP product: BTC MOVE Receipt

BTC MOVE Receipt is the primary MVP product.

A user buys movement exposure rather than choosing direction:

- the UP leg covers a move above the upper strike;
- the DOWN leg covers a move below the lower strike;
- the receipt aggregates those legs into one product-level portfolio item.

The MVP should keep BTC MOVE front-and-center. UP, DOWN, and RANGE should be treated as advanced primitives, diagnostics, or future composer building blocks.

## Can users manually buy UP + DOWN themselves?

Yes. Advanced users can manually buy UP + DOWN through DeepBook Predict and create similar exposure themselves.

DeepVol's value is not exclusivity. DeepVol does not rely on hiding a payoff structure that cannot be copied.

DeepVol's value is productization: turning a multi-leg Predict strategy into a one-click, protocol-enforced, trackable, displayable, and guided receipt product.

## Why DeepVol still adds value

DeepVol adds value through:

- one-call multi-leg execution;
- protocol-enforced receipt creation;
- standardized BTC MOVE series;
- MoveReceipt portfolio aggregation;
- unified settlement guidance;
- risk visualization;
- fee accounting.

Advanced users can construct the raw legs themselves, but most users should not need to manually choose two binary markets, coordinate quantities, inspect both quotes, manage post-mint readback, and track settlement separately.

## Fee model boundary

Primitive UP, DOWN, and RANGE trades are not the primary MVP monetization surface. In MVP, primitive surfaces should have no DeepVol protocol fee or should remain advanced/debug-only.

BTC MOVE Receipt is the MVP monetization surface:

```text
Create Fee = 0.30% of premium
```

The premium basis is the total immediate DeepBook Predict quote for the UP and DOWN legs. The Create Fee goes to DeepVol `ProtocolVault<Quote>` during receipt creation.

## Future structured products

Future products can reuse the same product-layer model:

- custom receipt composer;
- BTC STAY / range-bound product;
- other MOVE underlyings after runtime market validation;
- curated or creator-authored VolSeries after the enforcement and distribution model is clearer.

These future products should keep the same boundary: DeepBook Predict owns primitive pricing and settlement; DeepVol owns structured product packaging, receipt metadata, fee accounting, and UX.

## MVP receipt boundary

The MVP `MoveReceipt` is non-custodial but protocol-enforced. It records linkage to positions held in the user's `PredictManager`; it does not own the UP or DOWN legs.

Portfolio truth for active quantities must come from DeepBook Predict readback, especially `predict_manager::position` for each binary `MarketKey`.

Because users can redeem directly through DeepBook Predict, Profit Fee and custodial receipt semantics are V2 features, not MVP assumptions.
