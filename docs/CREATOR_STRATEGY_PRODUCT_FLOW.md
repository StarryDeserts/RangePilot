Purpose: Describe the Phase 3A/B creator strategy product flow that will later sit on top of the Route B wrapper.
Audience: Product leads, frontend developers, SDK implementers, Move developers, reviewers, and AI agents.
Status: Draft product-flow reference for Route B wrapper architecture; not final UI design.
Source of truth relationship: Supplements product architecture and wrapper docs; official DeepBook Predict docs remain source of truth for protocol behavior.

# Creator Strategy Product Flow

This flow describes how RangePilot's creator strategy layer should work once the Route B wrapper is published and integrated. Phase 3A/B does not build final UI pages; it defines the product path and minimal contract boundary.

## Flow overview

```text
Creator creates strategy
→ user discovers strategy
→ user previews follow
→ frontend runs official quote + full preflight
→ user follows strategy through RangePilot wrapper
→ wrapper internally calls DeepBook Predict mint_range<DUSDC>
→ user portfolio shows DeepBook Predict range position linked to strategy
→ creator sees followers, volume, and fees through indexed events
```

## 1. Creator creates strategy

A creator defines a compact range strategy:

- market/oracle target;
- expiry;
- lower strike;
- higher strike;
- default quantity;
- creator fee bps;
- platform fee bps;
- metadata URI or metadata hash;
- thesis/title/description off-chain where appropriate.

The wrapper stores the executable fields in a `Strategy` object and emits `StrategyCreated`. The strategy must not store private keys, signatures, raw transaction bytes, wallet caches, or protocol snapshots that must be confirmed at runtime.

## 2. Strategy has market/range/expiry/thesis/fee

The strategy should separate executable fields from descriptive metadata:

| Data | Recommended location | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle ID | On-chain Strategy | Required for wrapper `RangeKey`. |
| Expiry | On-chain Strategy | Required for wrapper `RangeKey`. |
| Lower/higher strike | On-chain Strategy | Required for wrapper `RangeKey`; range semantics are `(lower, higher]`. |
| Default quantity | On-chain Strategy | Useful for default follow UX and events. |
| Fee bps | On-chain Strategy | Required for transparent fee validation. |
| Thesis/title/description | Off-chain URI/hash | Larger, mutable presentation data should not bloat the object. |
| Creator analytics | Indexer/off-chain | Derived from events and DeepBook Predict state. |

## 3. User discovers strategy

Discovery can use off-chain indexing and public read models:

- list active strategies;
- show creator address/profile;
- show range and expiry;
- explain `(lower, higher]` payoff;
- show fee policy;
- show historical follow volume and known mints;
- show stale/unavailable state if oracle or market data cannot be refreshed.

Discovery must not imply mintability. Mintability is runtime-dependent and must be confirmed by quote and full preflight immediately before wallet approval.

## 4. User previews follow

Before calling the wrapper, the frontend must run the official DeepBook Predict validation path:

1. load current OracleSVI/public server state;
2. build the Strategy-derived RangeKey;
3. run official `predict::get_range_trade_amounts` quote;
4. verify mint cost is positive and affordable from `PredictManager` balance;
5. run full `predict::mint_range<DUSDC>` devInspect preflight;
6. show creator/platform fee separately from mint cost.

Quote success alone must not enable follow. Full mint preflight remains the safety gate.

## 5. User follows strategy

When preview gates pass, the user approves one wallet transaction to the RangePilot wrapper. The wrapper validates the Strategy and fee policy, then internally calls DeepBook Predict `mint_range<DUSDC>`.

The user remains the owner of their `PredictManager`. DeepBook Predict validates `ctx.sender() == manager.owner()` during `mint_range`, and positions remain internal quantities in the manager.

## 6. Wrapper mints DeepBook Predict range

The wrapper does not mint a RangePilot position NFT. It calls DeepBook Predict, which:

- checks the quote asset;
- checks live oracle/range consistency;
- inserts range exposure into the Vault;
- refreshes oracle risk;
- checks post-trade ask bounds and exposure;
- withdraws mint cost from `PredictManager`;
- increases the manager's range position;
- emits `RangeMinted`.

RangePilot emits `StrategyFollowed` only after the protocol call returns successfully.

## 7. User portfolio links position to strategy

The portfolio should use layered reads:

- RangePilot `StrategyFollowed` event for attribution;
- DeepBook Predict `RangeMinted` event for official mint details;
- direct `predict_manager::range_position` for wallet-critical active quantity;
- public Predict server summaries/history as diagnostic or display acceleration only.

Positions and ranges are not independent NFTs. The source of truth is the user's `PredictManager`.

## 8. Creator sees volume, followers, and fees

Creator analytics can be derived from events:

- `StrategyCreated` for catalog and metadata;
- `StrategyFollowed` for strategy follow count, fee amount, manager ID, and quantity;
- DeepBook Predict `RangeMinted` for official protocol mint details;
- DeepBook Predict `RangeRedeemed` for later lifecycle outcomes.

These analytics can remain off-chain/indexer-backed for MVP. They do not require RangePilot to reimplement pricing or vault risk.

## Out of scope for Phase 3A/B

- final strategy pages;
- final visual design;
- creator profile system;
- strategy ranking algorithm;
- vault dashboard;
- AI composer;
- publish/deploy flow;
- real follow transactions;
- mainnet support.
