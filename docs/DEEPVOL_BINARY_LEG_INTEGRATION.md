# DeepVol Binary Leg Integration

## Why this matters

DeepVol is a Predict-native structured product layer. UP, DOWN, and RANGE are advanced primitives; BTC MOVE Receipt is the primary composed MVP product.

DeepVol BTC MOVE depends on composing two DeepBook Predict binary legs:

```text
Long UP above upper strike
+
Long DOWN below lower strike
=
BTC MOVE exposure
```

Advanced users can manually buy UP + DOWN through DeepBook Predict. DeepVol's value is not exclusivity; it is standardized series selection, atomic multi-leg execution, receipt-based portfolio aggregation, fee accounting, guided settlement/redeem, and simpler risk display.

Range mint has been validated end-to-end through the existing RangePilot wrapper work. Binary quote/read/preflight is now DeepVol-critical and still needs dedicated validation before production DeepVol coding.

## Source-confirmed binary key construction

`MarketKey` identifies a binary option position with:

- `oracle_id`;
- `expiry`;
- `strike`;
- `direction`.

Source-confirmed constructors:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `market_key::up(oracle_id, expiry, strike)` | Construct an UP binary key. |
| `market_key::down(oracle_id, expiry, strike)` | Construct a DOWN binary key. |
| `market_key::new(oracle_id, expiry, strike, is_up)` | Construct UP when `is_up = true`; DOWN when `is_up = false`. |

Source-confirmed direction constants are `DIRECTION_UP = 0` and `DIRECTION_DOWN = 1`. DeepVol SDK and Move code should prefer constructors instead of hardcoded direction values where possible.

## UP / DOWN semantics for BTC MOVE

- UP leg: long above the upper strike.
- DOWN leg: long below the lower strike.

A BTC MOVE Receipt should record both keys or the fields needed to reconstruct them.

## Quote preview method

Binary quote preview is source-confirmed as:

```move
predict::get_trade_amounts(
    predict: &Predict,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    key: MarketKey,
    quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
): (u64, u64)
```

The return values are the mint cost and redeem payout for the binary market at the requested quantity.

DeepVol should preview both legs before mint:

1. `market_key::up(oracle_id, expiry, upper_strike)`.
2. `predict::get_trade_amounts` for the UP key.
3. `market_key::down(oracle_id, expiry, lower_strike)`.
4. `predict::get_trade_amounts` for the DOWN key.

## Current validation harness

`scripts/validate-deepvol-binary-legs.mjs` has three modes:

- `npm run validate:deepvol-binary-read` discovers active BTC oracle candidates, constructs UP/DOWN `MarketKey` values with official constructors, quotes both legs with `predict::get_trade_amounts`, and optionally reads `predict_manager::position` when `--sender` and `--manager` are supplied.
- `npm run validate:deepvol-binary-preflight` first runs read-mode selection, then requires explicit `--sender` and `--manager` before building a two-leg `predict::mint<DUSDC>` PTB for `devInspect` only.
- `npm run validate:deepvol-binary-mint` runs the controlled Testnet mint gates for the known funded sender/manager, prints gas and command diagnostics, and stays dry-run-only unless `--execute-real-mint` is explicitly supplied.

Safety properties:

- no private key is loaded;
- `.env.local` is not read;
- mint mode is dry-run-only by default;
- real submission requires explicit sender/manager, Testnet CLI env/address, manager balance, gas balance, transaction-shape assertion, `devInspect`, SDK dry-run, CLI dry-run, and `--execute-real-mint`;
- binary redeem remains not executed in this round.

Latest harness result from 2026-05-18:

| Field | Result |
|---|---|
| Selected BTC oracle | `0xc746336e790db7e93a34b684fa3768f43a7c3171d0262d0f2c71dc0a2ab5fe22` |
| Selected expiry | `1779436800000` |
| Lower / upper strikes | Read mode selected `76310000000000 / 76418000000000`; preflight reran at runtime and selected `76306000000000 / 76409000000000`. |
| UP MarketKey construction | `market_key::up(oracle, 1779436800000, 76418000000000)` in read mode; `market_key::up(oracle, 1779436800000, 76409000000000)` in preflight mode. |
| DOWN MarketKey construction | `market_key::down(oracle, 1779436800000, 76310000000000)` in read mode; `market_key::down(oracle, 1779436800000, 76306000000000)` in preflight mode. |
| UP quote result | Read mode `mint=495`, `redeem=475`, `quantity=1000`; preflight rerun `mint=498`, `redeem=478`, `quantity=1000`. |
| DOWN quote result | Read mode `mint=510`, `redeem=490`, `quantity=1000`; preflight rerun `mint=507`, `redeem=487`, `quantity=1000`. |
| Binary readback result | With sender `0x4ff903b0dcc52dc8753787baf19b34b7425dfa64d187cc7c726b38413705fa75` and manager `0xd59be0646d948c9be6073edc0cfd253ce4cb00f4929f0bae71f451f50e5d1575`, UP position `0`, DOWN position `0`. |
| Two-leg PTB preflight result | Passed with explicit sender/manager through `client.devInspectTransactionBlock`; no signing or execution. |
| Blockers | Live binary mint/redeem not executed in this round. Future wallet approval still needs fresh runtime quote, manager balance, fee coverage, and full two-leg preflight. |

Latest controlled mint-mode result from 2026-05-19 is recorded in [DEEPVOL_BINARY_MINT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md](./DEEPVOL_BINARY_MINT_TESTNET_VALIDATION.md): the old `100000000` MIST gas budget reproduced `InsufficientGas in command 3`, where command `3` is the second `predict::mint` if zero-based and `market_key::down` if one-based. Raising the budget to `200000000` MIST passed SDK dry-run and CLI `serialized-tx-kind` dry-run, then one real Testnet two-leg mint executed with digest `4fMQtu8mFB6jLa5gtSWBsDj3gYp8u9AjQw3xs2VcNJoh`. UP and DOWN positions each increased by `1000`, and manager DUSDC decreased by `1003` atomic units.

Quote success and `devInspect` success do not imply executable CLI submission. The full two-leg PTB still requires fresh quote, manager balance, gas, `devInspect`, SDK or wallet dry-run, CLI dry-run or wallet simulation equivalent, and wallet approval gates before any future production mint.

## Binary mint entrypoint

Binary mint is source-confirmed as:

```move
predict::mint<Quote>(
    predict: &mut Predict,
    manager: &mut PredictManager,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    key: MarketKey,
    quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

Required objects and type parameters:

| Item | Role |
|---|---|
| `Predict` | Shared DeepBook Predict trading object. |
| `PredictManager` | User manager that pays premium and receives binary position quantity. |
| `OracleSVI` | Oracle object for the selected BTC market. |
| `MarketKey` | UP or DOWN binary key. |
| `Clock` | Sui clock object. |
| `Quote` | Quote asset type parameter, DUSDC for current Testnet integration. |

The mint entrypoint checks manager ownership, trading pause state, positive quantity, quote asset, oracle/key match, live oracle state, mintable ask, manager balance, and vault exposure limits. DeepVol must not duplicate that pricing/risk logic.

## Binary redeem entrypoints

Source-confirmed binary redeem functions:

```move
predict::redeem<Quote>(
    predict: &mut Predict,
    manager: &mut PredictManager,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    key: MarketKey,
    quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

```move
predict::redeem_permissionless<Quote>(
    predict: &mut Predict,
    manager: &mut PredictManager,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    key: MarketKey,
    quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

`redeem` is owner-mediated. `redeem_permissionless` requires the oracle to be settled and deposits through the permissionless manager path.

DeepVol MVP can guide redeem, but non-custodial receipts cannot force users to redeem through DeepVol.

## Manager readback

Binary position readback is source-confirmed as:

```move
predict_manager::position(self: &PredictManager, key: MarketKey): u64
```

DeepVol portfolio should read both:

- UP key quantity.
- DOWN key quantity.

The `MoveReceipt` should not be treated as authoritative for current binary balances because the underlying legs remain in the user's `PredictManager`.

## Events

Source-confirmed binary lifecycle events:

| Event | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PositionMinted` | Binary position minted for a manager. |
| `PositionRedeemed` | Binary position redeemed for a manager. |

A later SDK implementation should normalize these events and link them with DeepVol receipt events by transaction digest and fields.

## Preflight gates for later implementation

Before any production DeepVol mint flow:

1. Confirm active BTC oracle and expiry at runtime.
2. Construct UP key from upper strike.
3. Construct DOWN key from lower strike.
4. Preview UP leg with `predict::get_trade_amounts`.
5. Preview DOWN leg with `predict::get_trade_amounts`.
6. Ensure both mint costs are nonzero.
7. Ensure quote success is not treated as mintability proof.
8. Ensure manager DUSDC balance covers total premium.
9. Ensure fee coin covers Create Fee.
10. DevInspect the full two-leg PTB before wallet approval.
11. After mint, read back both quantities through `predict_manager::position`.
12. Verify expected `PositionMinted` events or direct position increases.

## Comparison with validated range flow

Validated prior work:

- Range quote and range mint preflight.
- Range wrapper follow transaction.
- `StrategyFollowed`, `PlatformFeeDeposited`, and DeepBook `RangeMinted` event evidence.
- Direct `predict_manager::range_position` readback.

DeepVol-specific remaining work:

- Preserve the `200000000` MIST gas budget finding in SDK/UI two-leg mint gates.
- Binary redeem validation.
- Binary event parsing in SDK.
- Binary direct readback helper in SDK.
- Non-custodial receipt creation around the two-leg mint path.

## Open blockers

- Active BTC oracle, expiry, and strikes are `MUST CONFIRM AT RUNTIME`.
- Production DeepVol flows must preserve the validated two-leg mint gates before wallet approval.
- Binary redeem path and post-settlement behavior are `MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING` guided settlement UX.
- Final `MoveReceipt` field types are `MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING` after translating the validated binary mint evidence into the receipt design.
