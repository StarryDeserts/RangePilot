# DeepVol Buy MOVE Receipt Testnet Validation

## Summary

DeepVol-5 validated the first deployed DeepVol BTC MOVE receipt path on Sui Testnet. The validation created one BTC `VolSeries`, passed fresh quote and preflight gates, executed exactly one real `receipt::buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` transaction, and verified the receipt, internal DeepBook Predict UP/DOWN mints, manager balance delta, binary position deltas, and DeepVol `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>` Create Fee deposit.

The executed receipt remains the MVP non-custodial model: the user's `PredictManager` holds the binary legs, and the `MoveReceipt` records protocol-enforced metadata/linkage.

## Network and deployed config

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Network | Sui Testnet |
| Active Sui CLI env | `testnet` |
| Active Sui CLI address | `0x4ff903b0dcc52dc8753787baf19b34b7425dfa64d187cc7c726b38413705fa75` |
| Sender / receipt owner | `0x4ff903b0dcc52dc8753787baf19b34b7425dfa64d187cc7c726b38413705fa75` |
| PredictManager | `0xd59be0646d948c9be6073edc0cfd253ce4cb00f4929f0bae71f451f50e5d1575` |

| ProtocolVault<DUSDC> | `0x1b9174645d70ac4caa2cfa0db5df59ac78a3ce0d3cca10f8be37e4c5d84f1a09` |
| AdminCap | `0xa0f062e01af265137324eb26489de788fee443e49376725bed84a877c99318b1` |
| UpgradeCap | `0x2b5224c317e2d517bbc7abb47740cce86234399e818077ac50e63e79b0298fc4` |
| DeepBook Predict object | `0xc8736204d12f0a7277c86388a68bf8a194b0a14c5538ad13f22cbd8e2a38028a` |

Object checks confirmed the DeepVol package exists as an immutable package, the AdminCap and UpgradeCap are address-owned by the sender, the `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>` is shared with the expected type, the DeepBook Predict object is shared, and the selected PredictManager summary owner is the sender.

## Workspace safety notes

- `move/deepvol/Move.toml` was treated as user-managed publish config and was not modified, restored, or staged by the validation round.
- `move/deepvol/Published.toml` was inspected as normal generated Sui publish metadata and contains no secrets.
- `.env.local`, `.env*`, `.local/`, `.claude/`, `.trace/`, `.traces/`, `deepbookv3-predict-package/`, and `deepbookv3-predict-testnet-4-16/` were not read or staged.
- No private key, mnemonic, signature, or raw transaction bytes were printed or committed.

## Runtime BTC market selection

The execute-mode run discovered fresh active BTC oracle contexts from the public Predict read model and selected this runtime pair:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Oracle | `0xc746336e790db7e93a34b684fa3768f43a7c3171d0262d0f2c71dc0a2ab5fe22` |
| Expiry | `1779436800000` |
| Lower / DOWN strike | `76696000000000` |
| Upper / UP strike | `76796000000000` |
| Quantity | `10000` |
| Create Fee bps | `30` |
| Metadata URI | `https://deepvol.local/series/testnet/btc-move-demo-1` |

Fresh quote selection before writes produced positive UP and DOWN quotes and a nonzero Create Fee:

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| UP quote before `create_series` | `4910` atomic DUSDC |
| DOWN quote before `create_series` | `5119` atomic DUSDC |
| Expected premium before `create_series` | `10029` atomic DUSDC |
| Expected Create Fee before `create_series` | `30` atomic DUSDC |
| Computed maxPremiumPaid | `12034` atomic DUSDC |

The final buy preflight refreshed the quotes immediately before `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>`:

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| UP quote before buy | `4915` atomic DUSDC |
| DOWN quote before buy | `5114` atomic DUSDC |
| Expected premium before buy | `10029` atomic DUSDC |
| Create Fee before buy | `30` atomic DUSDC |

| Shared object | Yes |
| `VolSeriesCreated` event found | Yes |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `owner` | `0x4ff903b0dcc52dc8753787baf19b34b7425dfa64d187cc7c726b38413705fa75` |

## PredictManager position and balance readback

| Item | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| UP binary position | `0` | `10000` | `10000` |
| DOWN binary position | `0` | `10000` | `10000` |
| PredictManager DUSDC balance | `998962` | `988933` | `10029` decrease |

The `MoveReceiptCreated.premium_paid` value equals the actual manager DUSDC balance delta.

## ProtocolVault fee accounting

| Item | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ProtocolVault<DUSDC> balance | `0` | `30` | `30` increase |
| Selected fee coin balance | `45989000` | `45988970` | `30` decrease |

`MoveReceiptCreated.create_fee_paid`, `CreateFeeDeposited.amount`, the selected fee coin decrease, and the `ProtocolVault<DUSDC>` balance delta all match at `30` atomic DUSDC.

## Blockers or mismatches

No blocker or post-state mismatch was observed in this validation round.

Future executions still require fresh runtime oracle, expiry, strike, quote, manager balance, fee coin, gas, devInspect, and dry-run gates because BTC market state and DeepBook Predict mintability are runtime conditions.

## Explicit non-actions

- No `sui client publish` command was run.
- No package upgrade was run.
- No `create_protocol_vault` transaction was run.
- No `withdraw_protocol_fees` transaction was run.
- No Predict binary redeem or permissionless redeem was run.
- No range mint or range redeem was run.
- No old RangePilot `follow_strategy_and_mint` transaction was run.
- No mainnet path was used.
- No second `create_series` transaction was submitted in the validation run.
- No second `buy_move_receipt<DUSDC>` transaction was submitted in the validation run.

## DeepVol-6 frontend scaffold note

DeepVol-6 uses the validated VolSeries and receipt in this document as reference artifacts for the new `apps/deepvol-web/` wallet-gated frontend scaffold. The historical quote values recorded above are validation evidence only; they are not live offers and must not be displayed as current quotes.

The frontend must refresh quote, fee coin, gas, and preflight state at runtime before enabling wallet approval. If browser-safe full preflight is unavailable, the buy button must remain disabled with the exact blocker shown.

## Next step

Finish browser-safe quote/preflight/readback helpers or polish the transaction step UX from the `apps/deepvol-web/` scaffold, depending on which blockers remain after verification.
