# ADR-0002: Wrapper-internal mint Route B

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-17

## Context

Phase 2B completed the browser wallet engineering scaffold and fixed manual validation blockers for candidate scan and portfolio RangeKey recovery. Browser wallet testing has validated the direct DeepBook Predict lifecycle: create manager, deposit DUSDC, mint a range, read portfolio quantity, and redeem.

RangePilot now needs its own creator strategy and business layer. The user explicitly selected Route B:

```text
Route B — wrapper contract internally calls DeepBook Predict mint_range.
```

Official Sui DeepBook Predict docs and local source analysis confirm the key protocol boundary:

- DeepBook Predict is a prediction market protocol, not ML prediction.
- `Predict` is the main shared trading entrypoint.
- `PredictManager` is the per-user account and position boundary.
- Range positions are internal `PredictManager` quantities, not standalone NFTs.
- `RangeKey` identifies vertical ranges with `(lower, higher]` settlement semantics.
- `OracleSVI` supplies market/pricing state.
- `Vault` owns liquidity, exposure, MTM, max payout, and risk state.
- The public Predict server is a read model, not a write path.
- `predict::mint_range<Quote>` is public and owns the official mint logic.

Local source signature:

```move
public fun mint_range<Quote>(
    predict: &mut Predict,
    manager: &mut PredictManager,
    oracle: &OracleSVI,
    key: RangeKey,
    quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

## Decision

Build a thin RangePilot wrapper package skeleton.

The wrapper will:

- define `Strategy` data and lifecycle events;
- validate RangePilot strategy active state;
- validate wrapper fee policy;
- construct `RangeKey` from Strategy fields;
- call DeepBook Predict `predict::mint_range<DUSDC>` or generic `predict::mint_range<T>` internally;
- emit `StrategyFollowed` after the DeepBook Predict call succeeds.

The wrapper will not:

- implement pricing;
- implement oracle settlement;
- implement vault risk;
- implement StrikeMatrix;
- calculate payout;
- replace `PredictManager`;
- custody positions;
- treat the public server as a write path.

The existing direct DeepBook Predict SDK lifecycle remains valid for quote, diagnostics, and full preflight. Future wrapper UX must still run official quote + full `mint_range<DUSDC>` preflight before wallet approval.

## Alternatives considered

### Route A: frontend-only PTB orchestration

The frontend could build a PTB that calls DeepBook Predict directly and records strategy metadata off-chain.

- Pros: no wrapper package deployment.
- Cons: no atomic creator/platform fee enforcement, no on-chain Strategy object lifecycle, weaker attribution.
- Rejected because the user selected wrapper-internal minting.

### Event-recorder-only strategy layer

RangePilot could emit StrategyCreated/StrategyFollowed events without calling DeepBook Predict internally.

- Pros: simpler contract.
- Cons: follow attribution can diverge from actual mint execution; fee and mint are not one atomic wrapper action.
- Rejected because RangePilot should become the creator strategy + fee + DeepBook Predict mint entrypoint.

### Custom pricing/risk wrapper

RangePilot could compute quote/mintability/payout itself and only use DeepBook Predict as settlement infrastructure.

- Pros: more control.
- Cons: violates protocol boundary, duplicates pricing/vault/oracle/StrikeMatrix logic, likely unsafe and wrong.
- Rejected because DeepBook Predict must remain the pricing/risk/payout authority.

### NFT-like RangePilot positions

RangePilot could wrap or mirror range positions as standalone NFTs.

- Pros: familiar portfolio mental model.
- Cons: conflicts with DeepBook Predict design where range positions live as quantities inside `PredictManager`.
- Rejected for MVP. Attribution should be event/indexer-based.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Strategy validation, fee policy, DeepBook mint, and attribution can be one atomic transaction.
- DeepBook Predict remains the source of truth for positions and protocol behavior.
- Creator strategies become first-class RangePilot objects.
- Failed `mint_range` rolls back fee movement in the same transaction.

Negative:

- A RangePilot Move package must be deployed in a future round.
- Wrapper package ID is unknown until publish and must be `TBD` in config.
- SDK wrapper builders must block unless a package ID is explicitly provided.
- The wrapper build depends on the full local DeepBookV3 Testnet source snapshot at `deepbookv3-predict-testnet-4-16/packages/predict`; that snapshot is for local build/debug only and must not be committed.

## Follow-up requirements

- Keep `move/rangepilot` compiling against `deepbookv3-predict-testnet-4-16/packages/predict`; current local verification passes `npm run move:build:rangepilot` and `npm run move:test:rangepilot`.
- Decide final fee product cap and platform recipient before publish.
- Publish wrapper only after explicit future approval.
- Add SDK transaction builders that default-block without wrapper package ID.
- Re-run official quote and full preflight before every future wrapper follow transaction.
- Add indexing plan to link `StrategyFollowed` with DeepBook Predict `RangeMinted` in the same transaction.
