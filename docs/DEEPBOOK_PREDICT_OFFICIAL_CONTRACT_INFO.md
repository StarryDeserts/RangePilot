## 2. Integration Model for RangePilot

The official docs recommend splitting reads by freshness and purpose:

1. Use the public Predict server for render-ready market, portfolio, vault, and history data.
2. Use Sui checkpoint or event streaming for lower-latency oracle updates.
3. Use direct onchain object reads immediately before or after wallet flows that require authoritative state.

RangePilot should follow this model.

### RangePilot read/write separation

| Concern | Preferred source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Market list | Public Predict server | Use `/predicts/:predict_id/oracles`. |
| Oracle state | Public server, event stream, optional direct read | Use direct read around wallet-critical flows. |
| Portfolio summary | Public Predict server | Use manager summary endpoints first. |
| Portfolio confirmation after transaction | Direct read and/or events | Use server after it catches up. |
| Vault dashboard | Public Predict server | Use `/vault/summary` first. |
| Historical trades | Public Predict server | Use history endpoints. |
| Transactions | Onchain Move calls | Server is not a write path. |

Important:

The public server is a read model, not a transaction executor. RangePilot must build and submit Sui transactions for writes.

---

## 4. Core Protocol Objects

### Predict

`Predict` is the top-level shared object and the main app-facing trading/liquidity entrypoint.

Responsibilities:

- Validate quote assets.
- Check trading pause state.
- Check oracle and key validity.
- Price mints and redeems from oracle state.
- Apply spread and utilization adjustments.
- Update vault exposure.
- Emit trading and liquidity events.

RangePilot usage:

- Pass the confirmed Predict object ID into `mint_range`, `redeem_range`, `get_range_trade_amounts`, `supply`, and `withdraw`.
- Do not recreate or administer Predict.

### PredictManager

`PredictManager` is a per-user shared account object.

Responsibilities:

- Wrap an inner DeepBook `BalanceManager`.
- Store deposited quote balances.
- Track binary positions internally.
- Track vertical range positions internally.

Important:

Positions and ranges are not standalone onchain objects. They are quantities stored inside the manager.

RangePilot product mapping:

```text
PredictManager = Predict Account
PredictManager balance = deposited DUSDC balance
range_positions = user active range predictions
positions = user binary predictions
```

### OracleSVI

`OracleSVI` is the market state for one underlying asset and one expiry.

Responsibilities:

- Store spot price.
- Store forward price.
- Store SVI volatility surface parameters.
- Store activation state.
- Store timestamp.
- Store settlement price after expiry.

Lifecycle:

```text
Inactive -> Active -> Pending Settlement -> Settled
```

Trading rules:

- Mints require a live oracle.
- Redeems can use quoteable live or settled oracle state.
- After settlement, price and SVI updates are rejected.

RangePilot usage:

- Use server endpoints to discover active oracle IDs.
- Use oracle state to populate asset, expiry, status, current price, and settlement state.
- Do not assume static oracle IDs.

### MarketKey

`MarketKey` identifies binary positions.

Shape:

```text
(oracle_id, expiry, strike, direction)
```

Direction:

- UP
- DOWN

RangePilot priority:

- P2. RangePilot MVP can focus on `RangeKey` first.

### RangeKey

`RangeKey` identifies vertical range positions.

Shape:

```text
(oracle_id, expiry, lower_strike, higher_strike)
```

Rules:

- `lower_strike < higher_strike`
- Direction is not part of the key.
- Bull-call and bear-put ranges with the same strikes share the same key row.
- At settlement, a range pays when settlement lands in `(lower, higher]`.

RangePilot usage:

- This is the core MVP trading primitive.
- UI must clearly display the boundary rule as “above lower and at or below higher.”

### Vault

The Predict vault takes the opposite side of every Predict trade.

Responsibilities:

- Hold accepted quote assets.
- Track concrete asset balances.
- Track mark-to-market liability.
- Track maximum payout.
- Track per-oracle exposure.
- Support PLP supply and withdrawal.
- Support settled-oracle compaction.

Important:

`predict.move` owns pricing and trading orchestration. `vault.move` is the state machine for balances and exposure. RangePilot must not reimplement vault risk.

### PLP

`PLP` is the LP share coin minted when users supply liquidity to the Predict vault.

RangePilot priority:

- P1/P2 dashboard.
- Do not block the core range trading MVP on PLP supply/withdraw.

### Registry

The Registry tracks Predict object ID and oracle IDs associated with oracle caps.

Important:

Most app integrations do not call Registry admin functions directly. They are operator/governance surfaces.

RangePilot usage:

- Use the confirmed Predict object ID directly from official Testnet config.
- Do not call admin functions such as `create_predict`, `create_oracle`, quote asset management, pricing config, risk config, or withdrawal limiter setters.

predict_manager::position(self: &PredictManager, key: MarketKey): u64
predict_manager::range_position(self: &PredictManager, key: RangeKey): u64
```

RangePilot preferred read strategy:

1. Use public server manager summary endpoints for page rendering.
2. Use direct reads or devInspect/view calls for wallet-critical confirmation.
3. Use events as fallback for portfolio activity history.

Status:

```text
Confirmed read-helper roles; exact direct-read, devInspect, and server response shapes are MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING.
```

2. Use official server data if the server exposes equivalent quote output.
3. Use dry-run fallback if view/devInspect is not straightforward.

Status:

```text
Confirmed entrypoint role; exact TypeScript preview, devInspect, dry-run, and return mapping strategy are MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING.
```

---

## 5.6 Mint Range

Purpose:

Buy a vertical range position using DUSDC deposited in the caller’s `PredictManager`.

Move function:

- Subject to current vault value, max payout coverage, and withdrawal limiter.

RangePilot priority:

```text
P1/P2 after trade and portfolio flows.
```

---

## 6. Event Types

### Oracle events

The official docs list the following oracle events for live freshness:

```text
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::oracle::OraclePricesUpdated
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::oracle::OracleSVIUpdated
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::oracle::OracleSettled
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::oracle::OracleActivated
```

With the current Testnet package:

```text
0xf5ea2b3749c65d6e56507cc35388719aadb28f9cab873696a2f8687f5c785138::oracle::OraclePricesUpdated
0xf5ea2b3749c65d6e56507cc35388719aadb28f9cab873696a2f8687f5c785138::oracle::OracleSVIUpdated
0xf5ea2b3749c65d6e56507cc35388719aadb28f9cab873696a2f8687f5c785138::oracle::OracleSettled
0xf5ea2b3749c65d6e56507cc35388719aadb28f9cab873696a2f8687f5c785138::oracle::OracleActivated
```

### Trading and manager events

From pinned source:

```text
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::PositionMinted
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::PositionRedeemed
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::RangeMinted
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::RangeRedeemed
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::Supplied
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict::Withdrawn
<PREDICT_PACKAGE>::predict_manager::PredictManagerCreated
```

RangePilot usage:

- `PredictManagerCreated`: discover newly created manager ID.
- `RangeMinted`: update portfolio/history after mint.
- `RangeRedeemed`: update portfolio/history after redeem.
- Oracle events: update market status and freshness.
- `Supplied` / `Withdrawn`: vault activity history.

1. Read active range position.
2. Preview redeem if market is live.
3. Submit `predict::redeem_range<DUSDC>`.
4. Confirm `RangeRedeemed` event.
5. Refresh manager balance and position summary.

## 9. SDK Implementation Notes

### Suggested package config file

Path:

```text
packages/config/src/deepbookPredictTestnet.ts
```

Export:

```ts
export const DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_TESTNET = { ... } as const;
```

### Suggested SDK modules

```text
packages/sdk/src/deepbookPredict/
├─ client.ts
├─ config.ts
├─ server.ts
├─ manager.ts
├─ market.ts
├─ rangeKey.ts
├─ quote.ts
├─ trade.ts
├─ portfolio.ts
├─ events.ts
└─ errors.ts
```

### Suggested first TypeScript types

```ts
export type DeepBookPredictNetworkConfig = {
  network: "testnet";
  publicServer: string;
  packageId: string;
  registryId: string;
  predictId: string;
  quoteAssets: {
    DUSDC: {
      coinType: string;
      currencyId: string;
      decimals: 6;
    };
  };
  plpCoinType: string;
  sourceBranch: string;
};

export type OracleLifecycleStatus =
  | "inactive"
  | "active"
  | "pending_settlement"
  | "settled"
  | "unknown";

export type RangeInput = {
  oracleId: string;
  expiry: string | number | bigint;
  lowerStrike: string | number | bigint;
  higherStrike: string | number | bigint;
  quantity: string | number | bigint;
};
```

### Strike and quantity units

Treat strike, quantity, cost, payout, and balances as integer `bigint` values in SDK code.

Do not convert to JavaScript `number` except for display formatting.

DUSDC has 6 decimals.

## 10. Guardrails for Claude Code

Claude Code must follow these rules when using this document.

### Allowed

- Use confirmed Testnet config values from this document.
- Use public server endpoints for discovery and summaries.
- Build SDK stubs around confirmed entrypoint concepts.
- Mark untested PTB construction as `MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING` until validated.
- Use `TBD` where response shapes are not yet discovered.
- Use official source branch for additional verification.

### Not allowed

- Do not invent active oracle IDs.
- Do not invent market/expiry data.
- Do not invent strike grid values.
- Do not invent public server response shapes.
- Do not treat public server endpoints as write paths.
- Do not represent PredictManager positions as NFTs.
- Do not reimplement DeepBook Predict pricing.
- Do not reimplement oracle settlement.
- Do not reimplement vault risk or StrikeMatrix logic.
- Do not use old package IDs from prior experiments.
- Do not treat Testnet package IDs as future Mainnet IDs.

## 11. Open Questions for Next Claude Code Round

These should be answered by actual requests against the public server and/or testnet RPC.

1. What is the actual JSON shape of `/status`?
2. What is the actual JSON shape of `/predicts/:predict_id/state`?
3. What is the actual JSON shape of `/predicts/:predict_id/oracles`?
4. Which oracle IDs are currently active?
5. Which underlying assets and expiries are currently usable?
6. Where is strike grid data exposed in server responses?
7. How should RangePilot choose the first default market?
8. Does `/managers` support owner filtering or pagination parameters?
9. What is the best manager discovery strategy for a connected wallet?
10. Can `get_range_trade_amounts` be called through devInspect cleanly?
11. What is the exact PTB construction pattern for `RangeKey` as an intermediate argument?
12. What is the exact PTB construction pattern for DUSDC split + manager deposit?
13. How quickly does the public server index `RangeMinted` after transaction confirmation?

---

## 12. Suggested Document Placement

Recommended path in RangePilot repository:

```text
docs/DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md
```

Recommended updates after adding this document:

1. Add it to `docs/ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md` under protocol reference docs.
2. Add it to `docs/SOURCE_DOCUMENTS.md` as an official derived source.
3. Update `docs/PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md` with confirmed Testnet config.
4. Update `docs/ENTRYPOINT_BINDINGS_PLAN.md` with the confirmed entrypoint table.
5. In `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, require Claude Code to read this document before any DeepBook Predict SDK or PTB work.
