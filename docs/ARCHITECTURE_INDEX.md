# Architecture Index

RangePilot is a guided prediction terminal and creator strategy layer for DeepBook Predict. This index tells contributors which documents to read, what each document is allowed to justify, and which rules apply before implementation.

## Source-of-truth documents and official-derived references

| Document | Authority | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [range_pilot_product_architecture_spec.md](./range_pilot_product_architecture_spec.md) | Product, business, UX, MVP scope, engineering intent | Defining user flows, MVP priorities, product positioning, page structure, transaction lifecycle expectations |
| [deepbook_predict_模块架构解析.md](./deepbook_predict_模块架构解析.md) | Protocol architecture analysis and DeepBook Predict mental model | Mapping protocol objects, preserving pricing/oracle/vault/settlement invariants, understanding read/write surfaces |
| [DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md](./DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md) | Official-derived contract/config/endpoint/entrypoint integration reference | Confirmed Testnet deployment config, public server endpoints, entrypoint planning, and official-reference conflict checks |

Do not edit the product or protocol-analysis source docs for normal implementation tasks unless the user explicitly requests source-doc maintenance. If official Testnet config or entrypoint references conflict with older analysis notes, prefer the official-derived contract info while keeping runtime market state subject to live confirmation.

## Global anti-invention rules

- Mark unknown details as `TBD`.
- Mark chain/runtime or transaction-building details as `MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING`.
- Use confirmed Testnet deployment values only from [DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md](./DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md) and [PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md](./PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md).
- Do not invent or replace package IDs, shared object IDs, quote asset coin types, oracle IDs, market/expiry values, PredictManager discovery method, Move entrypoint signatures, RangeKey/MarketKey binary layout, quote preview return shape, or public server response schemas.
- Do not treat the public server as a transaction write path.
- Use local file references and section names in generated docs; the official contract info doc is the local place to preserve primary official reference links.

## Global no-rewrite rules

RangePilot must use official DeepBook Predict pricing, oracle, vault, and settlement logic.

Do not reimplement:

- pricing or SVI pricing
- oracle settlement
- vault risk logic
- StrikeMatrix logic
- custom payout rules
- custom prediction market protocol behavior

RangePilot may build UX, transaction construction, read normalization, portfolio visualization, creator strategy surfaces, and risk explanations around the official protocol.
