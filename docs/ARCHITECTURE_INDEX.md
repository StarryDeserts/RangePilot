Purpose: Navigation index for RangePilot and DeepVol architecture documentation.
Audience: Developers, product contributors, reviewers, and AI agents.
Status: Updated for the DeepVol BTC MOVE foundation refactor.
Source of truth relationship: Indexes local source-of-truth documents, official-derived protocol references, generated companion docs, and pivot ADRs; does not replace source docs.

# Architecture Index

DeepVol BTC MOVE is the new primary product direction. DeepVol is a Predict-native structured product layer on Sui: UP, DOWN, and RANGE are advanced primitives, while BTC MOVE Receipt is the primary composed product so users can trade movement, not direction.

RangePilot's guided range trading and Route B creator-follow wrapper work remains preserved as validated prior infrastructure. The creator-follow strategy model is no longer the primary product direction because public on-chain strategy parameters can be copied and used to bypass a high follow fee.

## Source-of-truth documents and official-derived references

| Document | Authority | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [range_pilot_product_architecture_spec.md](./range_pilot_product_architecture_spec.md) | Original product, business, UX, MVP scope, engineering intent | Historical RangePilot positioning and prior guided prediction assumptions |
| [deepbook_predict_模块架构解析.md](./deepbook_predict_模块架构解析.md) | Protocol architecture analysis and DeepBook Predict mental model | Mapping protocol objects, preserving pricing/oracle/vault/settlement invariants, understanding read/write surfaces |
| [DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md](./DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md) | Official-derived contract/config/endpoint/entrypoint integration reference | Confirmed Testnet deployment config, public server endpoints, entrypoint planning, and official-reference conflict checks |
| [DEEPVOL_PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md](./DEEPVOL_PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md) | Current product direction | DeepVol structured-product positioning, BTC MOVE primary product, and non-custodial receipt boundary |
| [DEEPVOL_PRIMITIVES_AND_RECEIPTS.md](./DEEPVOL_PRIMITIVES_AND_RECEIPTS.md) | Current product-layer model | Distinguishing Predict primitives from composed receipts and answering the manual UP + DOWN concern |
| [DEEPVOL_MVP_SCOPE.md](./DEEPVOL_MVP_SCOPE.md) | Current MVP scope | Deciding what belongs in the BTC MOVE MVP and what stays future scope |
| [ADR/0003-pivot-to-deepvol-btc-move.md](./ADR/0003-pivot-to-deepvol-btc-move.md) | Accepted pivot decision | Explaining why DeepVol supersedes creator-follow as the primary direction |

Do not edit the original product or protocol-analysis source docs for normal implementation tasks unless the user explicitly requests source-doc maintenance. If older RangePilot docs conflict with the DeepVol pivot, use the DeepVol foundation docs and ADR-0003 for current direction while preserving historical validation records.

## Local source snapshot note

`deepbookv3-predict-package/predict` is a non-committed local DeepBook Predict source snapshot used for Phase 1C-debug source-level diagnostics. `deepbookv3-predict-testnet-4-16/` is the full non-committed local DeepBookV3 Testnet source snapshot used for source-level debugging/reference. These snapshots may be read and cited by relative path when explicitly needed, but they must not be staged or committed. The formal RangePilot wrapper dependency source is the official DeepBookV3 Git repository with Testnet dep-replacements, not a local snapshot path; official docs remain the deployment/config source of truth.

## Global anti-invention rules

- Mark unknown details as `TBD`.
- Mark runtime market state as `MUST CONFIRM AT RUNTIME`.
- Mark chain/runtime or transaction-building details as `MUST CONFIRM BEFORE CODING`.
- Use confirmed Testnet deployment values only from [DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md](./DEEPBOOK_PREDICT_OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_INFO.md), [PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md](./PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md), and relevant validation records.
- Do not invent or replace package IDs, shared object IDs, quote asset coin types, oracle IDs, market/expiry values, PredictManager discovery method, Move entrypoint signatures, RangeKey/MarketKey layout, quote preview return shape, or public server response schemas.
- Do not treat the public server as a transaction write path.
- Use local file references and section names in generated docs; the official contract info doc is the local place to preserve primary official reference links.

## Global no-rewrite rules

DeepVol and RangePilot must use official DeepBook Predict pricing, oracle, vault, and settlement logic.

Do not reimplement:

- pricing or SVI pricing;
- oracle settlement;
- vault risk logic;
- StrikeMatrix logic;
- custom payout rules;
- custom prediction market protocol behavior.

DeepVol may build volatility product structure, transaction construction, receipt metadata, read normalization, portfolio visualization, fee collection, and settlement guidance around the official protocol.
